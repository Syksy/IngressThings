Various stuff for the GPS-game Ingress

## License

I don't own any of the intellectual rights to these. I've made these, mostly in Inkscape (SVGs), GIMP or TinkerCAD (STLs), but they're for everybody to use. So, CC0.

## Contents

### SVGs

Standard Vector Graphics files, mainly intended for use with Inkscape.

Main files of interest:

SVG:

- SVG/2S_Template.SVG : A 2nd Sunday template, which can be coupled with https://www.giacintogarcea.com/ingress/tools/missionset/ if exported at 200 dpi for full page 
- SVG/IngressAlphabetNumeric : A set of Ingress-like alphabet and numerics; note that the two rows differ in bridging; upper-one is friendly for 3D-printing with "hollowed" text

PNG:

- PNG/ExampleExport_NaantaliKylpyla_200dpi.PNG : Example export from Inkscape with 200 dpi from SVG/2S_Template.SVG as a bitmap, which can then be cropped into mission banner pieces.
- PNG/FS_TKU_logo.PNG : The Turku First Saturday Telegram group logo that's been in use for quite some time.
